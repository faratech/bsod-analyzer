# Gemini 2.5 Pro Enhanced Features

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced features implemented for the BSOD Analyzer using Gemini 2.5 Pro, including Google Search grounding and optimized parameters.

## Features

### 1. Gemini 2.5 Pro Model

The BSOD analyzer now uses Gemini 2.5 Pro, which includes:

**Current Configuration:**
```javascript
config: {
    temperature: 0.7,          // Balanced creativity and accuracy
    maxOutputTokens: 4096,     // Support for detailed analysis
}
```

**Benefits for BSOD Analysis:**
- Superior reasoning capabilities for complex crash patterns
- Better understanding of driver interactions and dependencies  
- More accurate root cause analysis
- Enhanced ability to trace through stack traces and identify culprits

**Note on Thinking Mode:**
According to Google's documentation, Gemini 2.5 Pro comes with thinking capabilities enabled by default. The `thinkingConfig` parameter with `thinkingBudget` appears to be available in some contexts but may not be fully supported through all API endpoints yet.

### 2. Google Search Grounding

For advanced debugging tools, the analyzer can use Google Search grounding to get real-time information:

```javascript
tools: [{
    googleSearch: {
        dynamicRetrievalConfig: {
            mode: "MODE_DYNAMIC",
            dynamicThreshold: 0.7   // Higher threshold for more relevant results
        }
    }
}]
```

**Important Notes:**
- Grounding with Google Search cannot be used with JSON response format
- It's available for advanced debugging commands that return plain text
- Costs $35 per 1,000 grounded queries

### 3. Enhanced Configuration

The analyzer now includes:
- Temperature: 0.7 for balanced creativity and accuracy
- Max Output Tokens: 4096 for detailed analysis
- TopK: 40 and TopP: 0.95 for diverse but focused responses

## API Configuration

### Server Configuration (server.js)

The server properly handles tool configurations:
- Converts `googleSearch` to `googleSearchRetrieval` for API compatibility
- Supports both new and legacy tool formats

### Client Configuration (geminiProxy.ts)

The client includes:
- Thinking mode configuration for complex analysis
- Support for Google Search grounding in advanced tools
- Enhanced parameter configuration

## Cost Implications

With Gemini 2.5 Pro:
- Input: $2.50 per 1M tokens
- Output: $10.00 per 1M tokens
- Grounding: $35 per 1,000 queries (only for advanced tools)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Deep Think Mode**: When available, integrate the experimental enhanced reasoning mode for even better analysis
2. **Thought Summaries**: Add support for exposing the model's reasoning process to help debug complex crashes
3. **Dynamic Thinking Budget**: Allow users to control the thinking budget based on dump complexity

## Usage Notes

1. The standard BSOD analysis uses JSON mode with high reasoning but no grounding
2. Advanced debugging tools can use grounding for real-time information
3. The thinking mode is set to HARD by default for maximum accuracy in crash analysis
